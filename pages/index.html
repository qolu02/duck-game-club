            “Hi, I’m Alec Meyer, founder and president of Duck Game Club. 
            Duck Game is a player-versus-player arcade-platformer shooter developed by Landon Podbielski 
            and published by Adult Swim Games. It released on Steam just over seven years ago on 
            June 4th, 2015, soon after which my father discovered it and introduced it to my siblings and I. 
            Duck Game was a beloved family pastime for us, and some years later when I received a laptop of my 
            very own, I purchased a digital copy of Duck Game in my own name to carry on the legacy. Since then, 
            I've formed countless valuable memories and friendships around playing Duck Game, and now, 
            I wish to bring that experience to you."
